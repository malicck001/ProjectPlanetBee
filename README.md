# ProjectPlanetBee

The repo for the project planet bee

Some example images can be found [here](https://next.freelab.org/index.php/s/toWTPb5W5Wqr9wi) if you need to try out stuff.
Real images will come soon.

The issues/task list can be found [here](https://github.com/opencampus-sh/ProjectPlanetBee/issues), you can also assign yourself to one task if you are doing it, so everybody will know who is doing what to avoid double work.

Hopefully we can try different approaches.
